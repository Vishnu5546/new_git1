When Jenkins receives a GitHub push hook, GitHub Plugin checks to see whether the hook came from a GitHub repository,

which matches the Git repository defined in SCM/Git section of this job. If they match and this option is enabled, GitHub Plugin triggers a one-time polling on GITScm. 

When GITScm polls GitHub, it finds that there is a change and initiates a build. 


The last sentence describes the behavior of Git plugin, thus the polling and initiating the build is not a part of GitHub plugin.

Thanks
